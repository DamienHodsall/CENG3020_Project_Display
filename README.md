# m4vga-rs

I'm slowly porting my C++ graphics demos into Rust. This exercise is half
technical, half ideological.

On the technical side, I suspected that Rust was finally up to the task, and
wanted to see how much of the demos and video driver could be expressed in safe
code.

On the ideological side, I think writing C++ in 2019 is negligent from a
security/reliability perspective, and so I'm moving my codebases out of it.
