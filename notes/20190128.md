# Actually trying to run the thing

After cleaning up a bunch of loose ends, I can start the system up. It
immediately panics, of course. This is good.

Immediate observation: getting a backtrace from a panic doesn't work. Even in a
debug build (a massive, massive debug build) gdb gets into an infinite frame
pointer following loop. So that's frustrating.

On the other hand, symbol demangling works flawlessly. And: I have spent the
past eight years confusing the ITM with the ETM. I don't have any hardware
capable of interacting with the ETM, but the ITM works amazingly well for
getting panic messages and output from the chip. Wish I had known about this
years ago! Thanks, Jorge.

Okay so why is it panicking.

In release builds the message is "ISR fired with HW available." In debug builds,
it's "unwrap on an Err value: Contended." The fact that those are different
is...alarming. But hey. They are at least very similar.

According to the PSR in the debug build we're in thread mode. So we're
attempting to `try_lock` and `unwrap` a `SpinLock` in thread mode... I only see
two cases of that, both during `configure_timing` before contention should be
possible. In fact, there are only two calls to `unwrap` in the thread mode
portion of the driver, both during `configure_timing`. Huh.


...both of these could point to spinlocks not actually working. The code looks
alright.


Heeeeeey I notice that I have configured the linker such that it will place Rust
values at address zero. This means we could have valid references that are zero,
which makes nonnull optimization unsound. Lemme go fix that. (Note that putting
the vector table at RAM address zero, as I did in C++, would solve this.)

Interesting. By fixing that, the debug build now matches the behavior of the
release build: it panics with "ISR fired without HW available." Yay!

Which ISR is it? xPSR says: 0x2D = 45 = ... `TIM8_TRG_COM_TIM14`? What? That
can't be right.

Oh, right, it's offset by 16 relative to vendor numbering. Man, I'm rusty. 45 -
16 = 29 = TIM3.

So we're panicking in the shock absorber. Great! Did I remember to initialize
it?

No I did not! Like, not *at all*. Well that's reassuring.

If I actually give the shock absorber the timer it needs to do its job, I get a
different panic! Yay! The new panic is:

    HW lock held at ISR: Contended

That's a *different* failure from the `acquire_hw` routine, one that occurs when
we get actual runtime contention between ISRs for use of hardware. Which ISRs?
And which hardware?

The contention appears to be for `HSTATE_HW`, and yet I don't see any actual
*contention* happening. I can do this:

    b acquire_hw
    commands
    p m4vga_rs::vga::HSTATE_HW
    bt 2
    end

and every time we hit `acquire_hw`, including the last one that seems to fail, I
can observe that `locked` is 0.

Oh interesting. The actual panic occurs in vector 0x2D, meaning TIM3, meaning
shock absorber. Aaaand if I go look, `SHOCK_TIMER` is in fact `locked`.

Ways this could happen:

1. ISR getting invoked reentrantly. Making this happen on ARMv7-M is actually
   kind of involved; I think this is unlikely.
2. Memory corruption from stray pointer write or overflow. I have some unsafe
   code, I can't immediately rule this out.
3. Really fantastically broken init routine.

Ah... the `SHOCK_TIMER` spinlock is in fact locked on the *first* spin through.
That points to my setup routine. There is, in fact, a race in the init routine
as written: TIM3's IRQ is likely to fire before we yield control of TIM3.

This race is also present in the C++ code, but is undetectable, since the ISR
will just perform racey accesses to TIM3.

I can avoid this by changing the order of initialization steps:

1. Enable TIM3. Interrupt pends immediately but is not yet enabled.
2. Donate TIM3 to `SHOCK_TIMER`.
3. Enable TIM4's IRQ.
4. Finally, enable TIM3's IRQ.

The order of the last two steps is critical: if I enable TIM3 first, it will
immediately fire, and *idle the CPU waiting for TIM4*, which is not yet enabled.


With that, I get an hsync output waveform that looks right, but vsync toggles
every hblank. Suggests that I forgot to update the vertical state machine... and
indeed I did.

Fixing that too and I have what looks like valid hsync/vsync output!
