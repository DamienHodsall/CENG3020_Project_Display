# Actually trying to run the thing

After cleaning up a bunch of loose ends, I can start the system up. It
immediately panics, of course. This is good.

Immediate observation: getting a backtrace from a panic doesn't work. Even in a
debug build (a massive, massive debug build) gdb gets into an infinite frame
pointer following loop. So that's frustrating.

On the other hand, symbol demangling works flawlessly. And: I have spent the
past eight years confusing the ITM with the ETM. I don't have any hardware
capable of interacting with the ETM, but the ITM works amazingly well for
getting panic messages and output from the chip. Wish I had known about this
years ago! Thanks, Jorge.

Okay so why is it panicking.

In release builds the message is "ISR fired with HW available." In debug builds,
it's "unwrap on an Err value: Contended." The fact that those are different
is...alarming. But hey. They are at least very similar.

According to the PSR in the debug build we're in thread mode. So we're
attempting to `try_lock` and `unwrap` a `SpinLock` in thread mode... I only see
two cases of that, both during `configure_timing` before contention should be
possible. In fact, there are only two calls to `unwrap` in the thread mode
portion of the driver, both during `configure_timing`. Huh.


...both of these could point to spinlocks not actually working. The code looks
alright.


Heeeeeey I notice that I have configured the linker such that it will place Rust
values at address zero. This means we could have valid references that are zero,
which makes nonnull optimization unsound. Lemme go fix that. (Note that putting
the vector table at RAM address zero, as I did in C++, would solve this.)
