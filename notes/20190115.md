The modern demos turn video on at the *end* of their rendering loops, because
it's idempotent and keeps them from flashing a frame of glitchy nonsense when
changing modes. I could factor such a pattern out.

I need to be able to give the driver (1) a table of rasterizers, and (2) a table
of bands citing those rasterizers. C++ used pointers. I could mandate the use of
`Rc`, but `Rc` uses the heap and I don't. Indices are the obvious choice.

Ideally, we could swap both out at any frame without intervening garbage. Some
demos also mutate the bands, which has potential for data races; probably better
to synchronize with vblank, disengage the bands, edit them, and re-engage them
before start of video.

The driver probably wants to have exclusive control of the rasterizers while
video is on (i.e. `&mut`). But we need to interact with rasterizers to do things
like pend buffer flips. This suggests shared references on both sides and
interior mutability where required. (Note: most rasterizers don't need it for
rasterization, but do need it for other APIs.)

That probably makes sense anyway, since the driver is effectively a separate
thread.


Huh. As a result, rasterizers probably need to be `Sync`.
