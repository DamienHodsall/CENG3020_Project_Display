# Hacking on binary size

Baseline release builds:
 
      text         data     bss     dec     hex filename
     23160           92  179628  202880   31880 conway
     20894           92  180872  201858   31482 horiz_tp
     20928           92  180808  201828   31464 xor_pattern

From inspection, a *lot* of those sizes are panic formatting related code.

There are no printlns in the source.

Dropping the `panic_itm` crate generates a warning about the need for the
`#[panic_handler]` item.

Adding `panic = "abort"`: still wants such an item.

Adding my very own `panic_handler` that enters an infinite loop.

    text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
    6600      92  179660  186352   2d7f0 conway
    4498      92  180872  185462   2d476 horiz_tp
    4536      92  180808  185436   2d45c xor_pattern

Well that's better. For the record, here are the C++ numbers.

    text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
    6895      16  179204  186115   2d703 build/latest/demo/conway/demo
    4463      16  179688  184167   2cf67 build/latest/demo/horiz_tp/demo
    4851      16  179624  184491   2d0ab build/latest/demo/xor_pattern/demo

Yes, both `conway` and `xor_pattern` are smaller in Rust.

---

I've added a cargo feature for controlling this. By default, the demos come up
with `panic_itm` support. To change that, use:

    cargo build --release --no-default-features --features panic-halt
