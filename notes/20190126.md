Starting to get a clearer idea of how driver state gets used by the ISRs, and a
factoring becomes evident.

    { next_use_timer, next_dma_xfer }
      written after rasterization
      read at horizontal SAV
    raster shape
      written after rasterization
      read in prepare-for-SAV

It occurs to me. For everything that is being transferred by copy, I could
provide a two-slot message queue. This would allow application code to be
updating the state even while interrupts occur; the interrupts would decidde
when to accept the next queue entry.

This eliminates a potential intermittent failure case for the spinlock version.
